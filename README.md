# Guided-Project---How-Does-a-Bike-Share-Navigate-Speedy-Success

This was a Guided Project I prepared while completing the Google Data Analytics course from Coursera.
Case Study was already provided and all it's steps were followed to complete this Project.

The Project was fun learning and also helped creating a better understanding of the tools used in Data Analytics including Git and Github used to manage multiple versions of code edits that are then transferred to files in a Git repository, GitHub serves as a location for uploading copies of a Git repository.

Analysis.R is the file which contains all the R code used with proper comments for better understanding starting from importing all the csv files provided to create visualizations some of which are uploaded as pictures undergoing the processing and cleaning of Data and having the Insights by analyzing it.
